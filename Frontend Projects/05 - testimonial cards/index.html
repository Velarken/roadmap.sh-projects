                This product truly changed my life! Since I was young, 
                I struggled to wash my car while also washing my dog. Thanks to this
                revolutionary new product, I am able to manage both at the same time.
                <br><br>Thank you, Sham-Paw (Car Edition)! You saved my family!

                I began working for Santa in 2011, and since then I've been able to
                do so many things I previously thought were impossible! For instance, 
                I was able to purchase a parcel of land at the North Pole. My elf wife 
                and I manage the homestead throughout the year, and travel North to the 
                pole to help with the holiday prep.
                <br>Santa also loves our fresh made cookies and unpasturized milk!

                    <p>First of all, when I rented this place, I thought I would be the ONLY 
                        resident in the shoe for the weekend. To my surprise, there were like 
                        14 children and a grandma living upstairs! Now, I don't mind sharing 
                        space with others, but for $1200 per night....this place was a SCAM
